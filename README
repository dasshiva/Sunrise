Sunrise - A Java Virtual Machine(JVM) implementation in C99

Sunrise is a barebones implementation written mainly with the intention of 
learning more about how Java and the JVM works under the hood. It is single 
threaded and lacks several features and last but not the least has more bugs
than I could count with my fingers. Regardless, it can perform basic operations
and supports all primitive and reference data types. It also has a standard
library (found inside the syslib directory). You should note that this VM does 
not work with the library that comes with the jdk. It is by no means something
you use in production. Nevertheless reading the code can give you an idea of
how VMs work in general. 

Sunrise was developed and tested on Linux and is guaranteed to work on Linux.
I am not aware if it works on Windows as I do not have a Windows machine at hand
currently.

Requirements:
1. A C compiler supporting at least the C99 standard (like clang or gcc)
2. The Meson build system (on Linux only)
3. GNU Parallel (on Linux only)
In addition, Sunrise depends on libgc[https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc] and will not work without it.
